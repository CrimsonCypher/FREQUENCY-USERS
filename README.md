# FREQUENCY-USERS


In the United Kingdom, frequency allocations are managed by Ofcom (Office of Communications), the regulatory authority for telecommunications and broadcasting. Here's a breakdown of frequency bands within the 0 MHz to 42 GHz range and who typically has control over each range in the UK:


    Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) and Super Low Frequency (SLF):

        Usage: Limited applications such as submarine communication and scientific research.
        Control: Primarily regulated by government agencies for specific purposes like military and research.

    Ultra Low Frequency (ULF):
        Usage: Used for specific applications like submarine communication and scientific research.
        Control: Regulated by government agencies for specialized purposes.

    Very Low Frequency (VLF):
        Usage: Used for long-range navigation, time signals, and submarine communication.
        Control: Regulated by Ofcom for specific applications and users.

    Low Frequency (LF):
        Usage: AM radio broadcasting, navigation, and some maritime communication.
        Control: Ofcom allocates frequencies to broadcasters and other users.

    Medium Frequency (MF):
        Usage: AM radio broadcasting, aviation communication, and maritime communication.
        Control: Frequencies are allocated by Ofcom to broadcasters, aviation authorities, and maritime agencies.

    High Frequency (HF):
        Usage: Shortwave radio broadcasting, amateur radio, aviation, maritime.
        Control: Licensed by Ofcom, with allocations for amateur radio operators, broadcasters, and other users.

    Very High Frequency (VHF):
        Usage: FM radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, aviation, marine, land mobile.
        Control: Ofcom allocates frequencies to broadcasters, emergency services, aviation, marine, and other users.

    Ultra High Frequency (UHF):
        Usage: Television broadcasting, cellular networks, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS.
        Control: Ofcom regulates and allocates frequencies to broadcasters, telecommunications companies, and other users.

    Super High Frequency (SHF):
        Usage: Satellite communication, radar, microwave links.
        Control: Ofcom oversees allocations for satellite operators, telecommunications companies, and other users.

    Extremely High Frequency (EHF):
        Usage: Radio astronomy, millimeter-wave communication, imaging.
        Control: Ofcom regulates allocations for scientific research, telecommunications, and other applications.

Ofcom ensures that frequency allocations are coordinated efficiently, considering the needs of various stakeholders while managing interference and spectrum scarcity issues.
